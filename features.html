    <h1>Features Of Python</h1>
    <p>Python has become popular over the years.<br> It became the programming language of choice for anyone who wanted to get work done quickly, made prototypes quickly, and easily use resources that were already in place. <br>Python‚Äôs popularity is due to many factors, but we‚Äôre going to focus on some of the most important features.</p><br>
    <h1> Simple And Easy To Learn</h1>
    <p>python is a simple programming language. When we read python program, we can feel like reading English statements.<br>
        Python is extremely easy to learn and has very simple syntax compared to other programming languages.<br>
        When compared with other language, we can write programs with very a smaller number of lines (i.e. concise code) in python. Hence more readability and simplicity in the python code.<br>
        The indentation is used instead of curly braces in python makes it very easy to read python code.<br>
        </p><br>
        <h1>Interpreted Language</h1>
        <p id="text">Interpreted in simple terms means running code line by line. An interpreted language is a programming language that an interpreter executes to produce outputs.<br>
            Python is called as an interpreted language as it uses interpreted to execute the code line by line.<br>
            Developer is not required to compile the source code explicitly unlike C, C++ and java. Python internally compiles the source code and converts into byte code.<br>
            </p><br><br>
            <button  class="more"onclick="text()">More</button>
            <h1>Dynamically Typed Language  </h1>
            <p> Python is a dynamically-typed language. Dynamically-typed means that, unlike other programming languages, in python, we need not declare the data type (for example, int, float, double, char, etc.) of a variable explicitly.<br>
                The data type of the variable is decided at run time. <br>Apart from this one variable can be used to store different types of data at different instances in the program.<br>
                </p>
                <h1>Object Oriented Programming Language </h1>
                <p>Python supports various programming paradigms like structured programming, functional programming, and object-oriented programming.<br> However, the most important fact in that the object-oriented approach of python allows its users to implement the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, etc. <br>which is extremely important to solve real-world problems using the object-oriented approach.<br></p>
                <h1>Platform Independent Or Portable</h1>
                <p>Platform independent refers that we write program once and it can run in any platforms. It follows ‚Äúwrite once run anywhere‚Äù concept.<br>
                    For example, if we write a python program on windows operating system then we can run the same code in Linux, Mac, or any other operating system without any changes. <br>This is because the python code first is converted to an intermediate from known as bytecode and is then executed.<br>
                    </p>
                    <h1>High-Level Language</h1>
                    <p>A high-level language (HLL) is a programming language that enables a programmer to write programs that are more or less independent of a particular type of computer.<br> These languages are said to be high level since they since they are very close to human languages and far away from machine languages. <br>
                        Python is a high programming language with very strong abstraction from the low-level constructs of the system or machine. <br>While writing code, the developer need not be concerned about the architecture, memory management, or the underlying machine type.<br>
                        </p>
                        <h1>Free And Open Source </h1>
                        <p>Python is a free/libre and open-source software (FLOSS).<br>
                            Python is freely available. We can download it from the python official website.<br>
                            Python is open-source. This means that its source code is available to the public.<br> Anyone can download it, change it, use it, and distribute it.<br>
                            </p>
                            <h1>Large Standard Library</h1>
                            <p>The standard library of python is extremely large with a diverse set of packages and modules.<br> If the code of some functionality is already present in these modules and packages.<br> The developers do not need to rewrite them from scratch, saving both time and effort on the developer‚Äôs end.<br></p>
<h1> Extensible And Embeddable </h1>
<p>Python is an embeddable language. We can write some python code into C or C++ language and also, we can compile that code in C/C++ language.<br>
    Python is an embeddable language. It means that we can extend python code in various other languages like C, C++, etc. <br>Too. This makes python an extensible language, meaning that it can be extended to other languages.<br>

    </p>
    <h1>GUI Programming</h1>
    <p>Python offers various libraries for creating graphical user interface for any application. <br>
        The toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython or Jpython allows for easy and support GUI.<br>
        </p>
